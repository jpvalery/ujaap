The development of visual builders and complex campaign management system eventually made obvious issues with such tools. More often than not, the easiness with which you can build a complex map of message makes you forget the end-user experience.
You end up with a cool looking web of messages and conditions which ends up being a hell to maintain and they don't always make sense for a user.
**Nobody wins, nobody's happy.**

## Why "micro"?
Based on the observation above, UJaaP was designed to prohibit such constructs. Following the Core Principles previously edicted, the campaigns can only take a certain shape and size. **A short succession of touchpoints with a clear and focused goal.**

## Symptoms of failure

You can quickly identify if it's not a micro campaign if you have the following symptoms.

### You have more than 5 touchpoints

While it might makes sense in your campaign builder, the reality is that there will be a zillion stimuli inbetween each of your touchpoints.

As a user, how can I keep track and sense of that? It's too big of an ask.

There's no way that a single goal can't be communicated in less than 5 messages. If you think otherwise, then the next points will probably enlighten you and change your mind.

### You're trying to get your users to accomplish multiple goals

People are busy. They have priorities outside of your product.

If you respect this, you can't ask them to accomplish more than one simple thing at once.

As a user, I don't have time to figure out *what's in it for me?* if I have to take 3 actions.

You should be able to show me immediate value with one single action.

Not only will this improve conversion funnels, but it will show mindfulness towards your users.

### You're basing your campaign on touchpoints rather than defined goal

By far this has been the biggest mistake I've seen in my career. I can't even count the number of times people have built their campaigns around X number of emails rather than a goal.

A classic example is a time-limited sale campaign. How often are those designed as

**" *we'll do an announcement, then a reminder, then a last chance with a bigger discount* "**

without even taking into account the benefit for the end-user or any form of goal beyond **make cash&trade;**...

How can this perform when there's no clear goal or value provided?

## Signs of success

### You identified a goal and benefit from the start

If you know where you're going and what's in it for the user, then everything will trickle-down from here.

You'll know what to offer, to whom, and why they should care.

### Your touchpoints are designed to trigger at the right time and right place

You're not just mindlessly sending an email every X hour, but you're building an experience or a journey for your user to embark on at a time and place that will either make sense or be convenient for them.

### The scope is defined in terms of entry, content, and exit

Armed with these, you know exactly when people should get in, what they'll receive and why, and how they will exit the campaign (either by reaching a goal or going through all the steps).
