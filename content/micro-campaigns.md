The development of visual builders and complex campaign management system eventually made obvious issues with such tools. More often than not, the easiness with which you can build a complex map of message makes you forget the end-user experience.
You end up with a cool looking web of messages and conditions which ends up being a hell to maintain and they don't always make sense for a user.
**Nobody wins, nobody's happy.**

## Why "micro"?
Based on the observation above, UJaaP was designed to prohibit such constructs. Following the Core Principles previously edicted, the campaigns can only take a certain shape and size. **A short succession of touchpoints with a clear and focused goal.**

## Do's & Don't's

### It's not a micro campaign if...
* You have more than 5 touchpoints
* You're trying to get your users to accomplish multiple goals
* You're basing your campaign on touchpoints rather than defined goal

### It's a micro campaign if...
* You identified a goal and benefit from the start
* Your touchpoints are designed to trigger at the right time and right place
* The scope is defined in terms of entry, content, and exit
